# coc-nvim-lua
Simple neovim lua completion source for coc.nvim!

This plugin reads content of lua global table to create completion list. No additional tools required (beside coc.nvim of course :D)

### WIP
This plugin is still under development. Currently, it's working fine... if you are using dot notation and don't make brakes between dots.

### Installation

With vim-plug:

```
    Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
    Plug 'rafcamlet/coc-nvim-lua'
```
